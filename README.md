## 🌟 What is Vexlo?

Have you ever had an amazing app idea but thought _"I don't know how to code"_?

**Vexlo changes everything.**

It's a complete, ready-to-use app that you can customize just by **talking to an AI**. No programming knowledge required. No complex setup. Just you and your ideas.

### ✨ What's Already Built For You

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🎨 **Beautiful Design** | Modern dark theme that looks professional from day one |
| 🔐 **User Accounts** | Login, registration, and user profiles — already working |
| 📱 **Mobile Ready** | Looks great on phones, tablets, and computers |
| 💾 **Database** | Store and retrieve data without understanding databases |
| 🚀 **Ready to Publish** | When you're ready, deploy to the web with one click |

---

## 🤖 How It Works

This is called **"Vibe Coding"** — you describe what you want, and AI builds it.

```
You: "Add a page where users can write blog posts"

AI: ✨ Done! I've created a new blog page with a text editor,
    save button, and connected it to your database.
```

It's like having a developer friend who works 24/7 and never gets tired.

### The Secret Ingredient: Antigravity

**[Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/)** is the AI assistant that understands Vexlo. Once you have Vexlo running, you open it in Antigravity and start describing what you want:

> _"Change the color scheme to ocean blue"_

> _"Add a feature to upload photos"_

> _"Create a dashboard that shows my daily sales"_

Antigravity reads your project, understands the structure, and makes the changes for you.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### What You'll Need

Before starting, install these three free programs:

| Program | What It Does | Download |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Node.js** | Runs the app on your computer | [Download here](https://nodejs.org/) — Click the green "LTS" button |
| **Docker Desktop** | Runs your local database | [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) |
| **Antigravity** | Your AI coding assistant | [Download here](https://antigravity.google/) |

Just download and install each one — accept all the default options, no special configuration needed!

### Step 1: Download Vexlo

Click the green **"Code"** button at the top of this page, then click **"Download ZIP"**.

Unzip the folder somewhere you'll remember (like your Desktop or Documents).

### Step 2: Open in Antigravity

1. Open the **Antigravity** app
2. Click **"Open Folder"** and select the Vexlo folder you just unzipped
3. Make sure **Docker Desktop** is running (you should see a whale icon in your taskbar)

### Step 3: Let Antigravity Do The Work

In the Antigravity chat, type:

> _"Initialize this project and start the development server"_

Antigravity will:
- ✅ Set up the project as YOUR OWN
- ✅ Install everything needed
- ✅ Start the local database
- ✅ Launch your app

### Step 4: See Your App! 🎉

Open your web browser and go to: **http://localhost:5173**

You should see the Vexlo landing page. **Congratulations — you have a working app!**

## 🎨 Start Customizing

Now the fun begins! In Antigravity, just describe what you want:

| What You Say | What Happens |
|--------------|--------------|
| _"Change the logo to my company logo"_ | AI updates the branding |
| _"Add a contact form"_ | AI creates a new page with a form |
| _"Make the buttons green instead of purple"_ | AI changes the color scheme |
| _"Add a page to list products with prices"_ | AI builds a product catalog |

**Pro tip:** Be specific! Instead of _"make it better"_, try _"make the landing page have a hero section with a big headline and a call-to-action button"_.
